At least\none filter set has to be true for the entity to be part of the result set\n(filter sets effectively have an OR between them).\n\nExample:\n\n```text\n/entities/by-query?filter=kind=user,metadata.namespace=default&filter=kind=group,spec.type\n\n  Return entities that match\n\n    Filter set 1:\n      Condition 1: kind = user\n                  AND\n      Condition 2: metadata.namespace = default\n\n    OR\n\n    Filter set 2:\n      Condition 1: kind = group\n                  AND\n      Condition 2: spec.type exists\n```\n\nEach condition is either on the form `<key>`, or on the form `<key>=<value>`.\nThe first form asserts on the existence of a certain key (with any value), and\nthe second asserts that the key exists and has a certain value. All checks are\nalways case _insensitive_.\n\nIn all cases, the key is a simplified JSON path in a given piece of entity data.\nEach part of the path is a key of an object, and the traversal also descends\nthrough arrays. There are two special forms:\n\n- Array items that are simple value types (such as strings) match on a key-value\n  pair where the key is the item as a string, and the value is the string `true`\n- Relations can be matched on a `relations.<type>=<targetRef>` form\n\nLet's look at a simplified example to illustrate the concept:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"a\": {\n    \"b\": [\"c\", { \"d\": 1 }],\n    \"e\": 7\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis would match any one of the following conditions:\n\n- `a`\n- `a.b`\n- `a.b.c`\n- `a.b.c=true`\n- `a.b.d`\n- `a.b.d=1`\n- `a.e`\n- `a.e=7`\n\nSome more real world usable examples:\n\n- Return all orphaned entities:\n\n  `/entities/by-query?filter=metadata.annotations.backstage.io/orphan=true`\n\n- Return all users and groups:\n\n  `/entities/by-query?filter=kind=user&filter=kind=group`\n\n- Return all service components:\n\n  `/entities/by-query?filter=kind=component,spec.type=service`\n\n- Return all entities with the `java` tag:\n\n  `/entities/by-query?filter=metadata.tags.java`\n\n- Return all users who are members of the `ops` group (note that the full\n  [reference](references.md) of the group is used):\n\n  `/entities/by-query?filter=kind=user,relations.memberof=group:default/ops`\n").optional(),
