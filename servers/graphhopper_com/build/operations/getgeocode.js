Each provider has its own strenghts and might fit better for certain scenarios, so it's worth to compare the different providers.\nTo try it append the `provider`parameter to the URL like `&provider=nominatim`,\nthe result structure should be identical in all cases - if not, please report this back to us.\nKeep in mind that some providers do not support certain parameters or don't return some fields, for example `osm_id` and `osm_type` are not supported by every geocoding provider.\nIf you would like to use additional parameters of one of the providers, but it's not available for the GraphHopper Geocoding API, yet? Please contact us.\n\nThe credit costs can be different for all providers - see [here](https://support.graphhopper.com/support/solutions/articles/44000718211-what-is-one-credit-) for more information about it.\n\nCurrently, only the default provider and gisgraphy supports autocompletion of partial search strings.\n\nAll providers support normal \"forward\" geocoding and reverse geocoding via `reverse=true`.\n\n#### Default (`provider=default`)\n\nThis provider returns results of our internal geocoding engine, as described above.\nIn addition to the above documented parameters the following parameters are possible:\n* `bbox` - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`\n* `osm_tag` - you can filter `key:value` or exclude places with certain OpenStreetMap tags `!key:value`. E.g. `osm_tag=tourism:museum` or just the key `osm_tag=tourism`. To exclude multiple tags you add multiple `osm_tag` parameters.\n\n#### Nominatim (`provider=nominatim`)\n\nThe GraphHopper Directions API uses a commercially hosted Nominatim geocoder. You can try this provider [here](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/). The provider does **not** fall under the [restrictions](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/) of the Nominatim instance hosted by OpenStreetMap.\n\nIn addition to the above documented parameters Nominatim allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://github.com/openstreetmap/Nominatim/blob/master/docs/api/Search.md#parameters):\n\n* `viewbox` - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`\n* `bounded` - If 1 and a viewbox is given, restrict the result to items contained within that viewbox. Default is 0.\n\n#### Gisgraphy (`provider=gisgraphy`)\n\nThis provider returns results from the Gisgraphy geocoder which you can try [here](https://services.gisgraphy.com/static/leaflet/index.html).\n\n**Limitations:** The `locale` parameter is not supported. Gisgraphy does not return OSM tags or an extent.\n\nGisgraphy has a special autocomplete API, which you can use by adding `autocomplete=true` (does not work with `reverse=true`). The autocomplete API is optimized on predicting text input, but returns less information.\n\nIn addition to the above documented parameters Gisgraphy allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://www.gisgraphy.com/documentation/user-guide.php#geocodingservice):\n\n* `radius` - radius in meters\n* `country` - restrict search for the specified country. The value must be the ISO 3166 Alpha 2 code of the country.\n\n#### NetToolKit (`provider=nettoolkit`)\n\nThis provider returns results from the NetToolKit provider which is specialized for US addresses and provides a wrapper around Nominatim for other addresses. You can try it [here](https://www.nettoolkit.com/geo/demo).\n\nThe following additional NetToolKit parameters are supported (read [here](https://www.nettoolkit.com/docs/geo/geocoding) for more details):\n- `source`: User can choose which source provider to geocode the address, this value is \"NetToolKit\" by default\n- `country_code`: an iso-3166-2 country code (e.g : US) filter the results to the specify country code\n\n**Limitations:** NetToolKit does not support the `locale` parameter. NetToolKit does not return OSM tags (e.g. osm_id, osm_type, osm_value).\n\n#### OpenCage Data (`provider=opencagedata`)\n\nThis provider returns results from the OpenCageData geocoder which you can try [here](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/demo).\n\nIn addition to the above documented parameters OpenCage Data allows to use the following parameters, which can be used as documented [here](https://geocoder.opencagedata.com/api#forward-opt):\n\n* countrycode - The country code is a two letter code as defined by the ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 standard. E.g. gb for the United Kingdom, fr for France, us for United States. \n* bounds - the expected format is `minLon,minLat,maxLon,maxLat`\n") }).optional() }).shape;
