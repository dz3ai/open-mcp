The response may also include dependencies of anything in the nodes' subtrees. For example, if a node subtree contains an instance of a local component that lives elsewhere in that file, that component and its ancestor chain will also be included.\n\nFor historical reasons, top-level canvas nodes are always returned, regardless of whether they are listed in the `ids` parameter.
